## Overview

Here’s a skill‑based roadmap tailored to you as a senior technical professional who thrives on modularity, clean architecture, and structured progression.
This roadmap is designed to take you from the simplest game on your list to the most complex, while deliberately building the exact skills you’ll need for each subsequent tier.

Organized it into Skill Tracks, Milestones, and Game‑Driven Skill Applications, so you can see how each project scaffolds the next.

## 🧭 Skill‑Based Roadmap for Building All Games (Easiest → Hardest)

## 🎯 OVERVIEW

Each game teaches a cluster of skills. By the time you reach Final Fantasy II, you’ll have mastered:

- 2D physics
- Tilemaps and world building
- State machines
- AI behavior trees
- Combat systems
- Inventory and UI frameworks
- Data‑driven content pipelines
- Large‑scale project architecture

This roadmap ensures no wasted effort — every skill you learn is reused and expanded.

## 🧩 SKILL TRACKS

### Track A — Core 2D Game Foundations

You’ll build these skills through:

- Nibbles.bas
- Breakout / Alleyway
- Gorillas.bas

### Skills Developed - Breakout

- Godot scene system fundamentals
- Node lifecycle (\_Ready, \_Process, \_PhysicsProcess)
- Input handling
- Basic collision detection
- Simple physics (velocity, acceleration)
- UI basics (labels, score, game over states)
- Deterministic game loops
- Procedural generation (Gorillas city skyline)
- Projectile motion math

### Why this matters - Breakout

These are the atomic building blocks for every game on your list.

---

### Track B — Systems Architecture & Rule Engines

You’ll build these skills through:

- President / A\*\*hole

### Skills Developed - President

- Card engine architecture
- Data‑driven rule toggles
- Turn‑based logic
- State machines
- Basic AI heuristics
- UI interaction patterns (drag/drop or click‑to‑play)
- Event‑driven programming

### Why this matters - President

This track teaches systemic thinking, which becomes essential for RPGs and Metroidvanias.

---

### Track C — Grid Systems, Rotation Logic, and High‑Precision Input

You’ll build these skills through:

- Tetris

### Skills Developed - Tetris

- Grid representation
- Piece rotation systems (SRS‑like)
- Lock delay, gravity, soft/hard drop
- High‑precision input buffering
- Random bag generation
- Game feel polish (particles, ghost piece, hold queue)

### Why this matters - Tetris

This track teaches tight control systems, which are critical for Mega Man and Super Metroid.

---

## Track D — Action Platformer Architecture

You’ll build these skills through:

- Mega Man (NES‑style)

### Skills Developed - Mega Man

- Advanced 2D physics (coyote time, jump buffering)
- Animation state machines
- Enemy AI patterns
- Projectile systems
- Boss logic
- Level design workflow
- Modular weapon system
- Hitboxes/hurtboxes
- Scene streaming

### Why this matters - Mega Man

This is your first “real” content‑heavy game. It teaches reusable patterns for Metroidvania movement and combat.

---

## Track E — Metroidvania Systems & World Cohesion

You’ll build these skills through:

- Super Metroid (SNES‑style)

### Skills Developed - Super Metroid

- Large interconnected world design
- Save system + map system
- Ability gating (morph ball, missiles, suits)
- Complex enemy behaviors
- Multi‑phase bosses
- Environmental storytelling
- Inventory and upgrade systems
- Scene streaming + world persistence

### Why this matters - Super Metroid

## This is the bridge between action games and RPGs — you’ll learn world structure, progression, and content pipelines.

---

## Track F — RPG Systems, Data Pipelines, and Content Scaling

You’ll build these skills through:

- Final Fantasy II (SNES)

### Skills Developed - FF2

- Turn‑based combat engine
- Character stats, spells, leveling
- Enemy database + balancing
- Dialogue system
- Cutscene scripting
- Overworld + towns + dungeons
- Shops, inventory, equipment
- Quest/event triggers
- Large‑scale content management
- Modular UI frameworks

### Why this matters - FF2

This is the most content‑heavy genre. You’ll learn to build tools, pipelines, and data‑driven systems that scale.
