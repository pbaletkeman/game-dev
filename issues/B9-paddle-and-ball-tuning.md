## Description
Refine paddle and ball physics behavior for more control and predictability.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Bounce angle depends on where the ball hits the paddle  
- Behavior feels responsive and skill-based  
- Physics parameters are adjustable in one place  

## Track
Track B — Breakout
