# Game Development Curriculum  
A structured, multi‑track roadmap for mastering Godot, C#, and game architecture.

This curriculum is built around six progressive tracks, each culminating in a complete, playable prototype.  
Every track contains ten issues, for a total of sixty hands‑on, scoped, and testable milestones.

The curriculum emphasizes:
- Modular skill acquisition  
- Clean, maintainable code  
- Reusable patterns  
- Progressive complexity  
- Project‑based learning  
- Deliberate practice and iteration

# Tracks Overview

**Track A — Godot Fundamentals (Nibbles)**  
Learn the Godot editor, 2D movement, collisions, UI, game states, and core scripting patterns.

**Track B — Breakout**  
Build a physics‑driven arcade game with paddle control, ball mechanics, scoring, and level progression.

**Track C — Gorillas**  
Implement projectile physics, gravity, wind, destructible environments, and turn‑based flow.

**Track D — President**  
Create a menu‑driven simulation with stats, events, choices, persistence, and win/lose conditions.

**Track E — Tetris**  
Develop a falling‑block puzzle game with grid logic, rotation, line clears, difficulty curves, and HUD.

**Track F — Metroid‑like**  
Build a side‑scrolling action‑adventure slice with movement, combat, enemies, pickups, and progression.

# Repository Structure

```
/issues/               # All 60 issue files
ROADMAP.md             # Progress dashboard

# How to Use This Curriculum

1. Work through issues in order within each track.  
2. Commit code with issue identifiers (e.g., A3, B7).  
3. Use ROADMAP.md to track progress.  
4. Use automation scripts to keep progress bars up to date.  
5. Treat each track as a self‑contained mini‑project.

# Automation

The `scripts/` directory contains tools for:
- Updating progress bars  
- Checking issue status  
- Maintaining consistency across the curriculum  

---

# Goals

By the end of this curriculum, you will have:
- Six complete prototypes  
- A reusable codebase of patterns and utilities  
- A strong foundation in Godot and C#  
- A portfolio of progressively complex games  
- A clear understanding of game architecture and workflow discipline
